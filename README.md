# Influenza Vaccination Prediction Model

## Introduction

This repository contains code for developing and evaluating a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of individuals receiving influenza vaccines. The model focuses on predicting the probability of individuals getting vaccinated against H1N1 and seasonal flu based on demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal features.

## Overview

The project aims to address the challenge of predicting the likelihood of individuals receiving H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccinations. By leveraging data from the 2009 National H1N1 Flu Survey conducted by the CDC, the model utilizes various features such as demographic information, behavioral patterns, and attitudinal responses to make accurate predictions.
